## Markdown

### Do I need to use an empty line after an image includion?

Markdown works best if we apply some defualt formating rules. This include the ample use of empty lines to indicate contect switches.
In general, please use empty lines after each context switch. THis includes:

* headings
* images with the `![ ]( )` inclusion
* lists
* lists within lists 
* paragraphs

### Should I use bulets or - for unnumbered lists?

Always use * 

### What is the indentation rule for lists?

Do not use tabs in list use spaces. make sure they are alligning with your . 

It is not 

```
* This is a list
     * This is a subitem
* line 3
* line 4 
```

but it is

```
* This is a list

  * This is a subitem

* line 3
* line 4
```

Note that the subitem is embedded in enpty lines and indented to the first character of the previous item
